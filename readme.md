Software developer challange
</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This was a short challenge for a job application, where I needed to replicate an existing design and implement an input form with name, email, and credit card number fields. The form had to meet the provided user stories and pass the prewritten tests.

### Task

- Develop a simple web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Implement the LUHN Algorithm for credit card validation
- Ensure the form adheres to user stories and passes prewritten tests
- As an extra touch, I added a responsive navigation bar and embedded the PDF challenge

## Run ðŸš€

`
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrasE/DN-Soft-Dev-Test
`

`
$ cd PROJECTNAME
`

`
$ open index.html
