            <h1>Hi there,</h1>
            <h2>Learning, Implementing, and Refining</h2>
            <p>I really enjoyed working on this mini-project! It was great to use the shared PDF as a structured guide,
                helping
                me
                break down my tasks step by step. After reviewing the document a few times, I organized my workflow as
                follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set up a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project, ensuring all files were correctly linked.</li>
                <li>Used Appendix A - User Stories (No. 5) to replicate the form's styling based on the
                    description
                    and shared image.</li>
                <li>Implemented basic validation for all inputs, highlighting errors in the specified color.</li>
                <li>Edited regex patterns for name and email fields to align with Appendix C - Simplified Test
                    Suite requirements.</li>
                <li>Learned about the Luhn algorithm by watching a short video (similar to the one in the PDF)
                    and
                    implemented it step by step.</li>
                <li>Reviewed Appendix C - Simplified Test Suite to identify and correct any failures in the
                    algorithm.</li>
                <li>Added some extra touches: a responsive navbar and a Challenge/Reflection
                    section.</li>
                <li>Did a final review—simplified the code, removed redundant classes, and ensured everything was clean
                    and
                    functional.</li>
                <li>Wrapped up with this reflection section.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Handling the Mailto Function Issue</h2>
            <p>I had to find a workaround since my Chromium-based browser wouldn't allow me to open the mail client
                directly.
                Fortunately, I had encountered this issue before, so I followed these steps:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Disable AdBlock (if enabled).</li>
                <li>Go to <code>chrome://settings/handlers</code> and enable <em>"Allow sites to ask to handle
                        protocols."</em>
                </li>
                <li>Open the browser console and type: <code>allow pasting</code></li>
                <li>Copy and paste the following command:</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
            navigator.registerProtocolHandler('mailto', 'https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=...%s', 'Gmail')
            </code>
            </div>

            <ol start="5">
                <li>Click <em>Allow</em> on the popup that appears.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Observations on User Stories & Design</h2>
            <p>I found the user stories easy to follow and didn't need to make many assumptions apart from the font size
                and
                family.
                However, I did notice a small typo—the hex code for the pink color is missing an "e" at the
                beginning. Also, the contrast between gray/black text and the pink background made readability a bit
                challenging.
            </p>

            <p>To improve accessibility, I adjusted the placeholder color on error states to white, which I
                believe
                makes it more user-friendly.</p>

            <h2>Reflections on the Learning Process and AI</h2>
            <p>The test cases were incredibly helpful. Having them before starting the project allowed me to visualize
                the
                end
                goal
                more clearly. I initially created a form that didn't pass, but step by step, I adjusted it until it met
                all
                the
                requirements.</p>

            <p>I also made use of generative AI, which has been a game-changer. Although I was skeptical at
                first,
                I've come to appreciate how useful it is. In the past, I would have multiple tabs open—MDN, W3C, Stack
                Overflow,
                Reddit—going through a lot of trial and error to find the right solution. AI doesn't always provide
                perfect
                answers,
                but it offers great ideas and significantly speeds up the learning process by explaining concepts
                without
                the
                need
                for extensive research.</p>

            <p>That said, AI has its shortcomings. It can encourage laziness—people might copy and paste solutions
                without
                fully
                understanding them, and in many cases, those solutions aren't entirely correct. I've encountered
                situations
                where
                AI-generated code relied on outdated package documentation, leading to errors. So while it's a
                fantastic tool, it's essential to use it with a critical mindset.</p>

            <p>I regularly use ChatGPT, Gemini, Codium, and GitHub Copilot, and I think they all have their
                strengths. However, I'm not particularly fond of Copilot's inline edits—I don't like having my
                code
                rewritten on the fly. I prefer the chat-based approach, where I can review suggestions and
                decide
                how to implement them myself. Maybe I just haven't gotten used to Copilot's workflow yet, but for now,
                that's my
                stance on it.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways from This Project</h2>
            <p>I've realized that every project, no matter how simple, always offers something new to learn.
                With
                this project, I gained a much deeper understanding of regex—I had used it before for basic form
                validation, but I had never really explored its full potential. Now, I can see just how powerful and
                versatile
                it
                is.</p>

            <p>I also had no prior knowledge of the Luhn algorithm, so learning about it was a fascinating
                experience. It's always exciting to come across new concepts that expand my problem-solving toolkit!</p>
